QUPay - Qt UPay implementation
==============================
-- UNTESTED --

Overview
--------
This is the implementation of the muccc upay protocol in QT.  It provides
classes to hold tokens and transction, controller classes to manage
the wallet and helper classes to communicate with the server and the wallet.

The imlementation is not yet finished.  Especially the part, where the
IO part should communicate with the server is not implemented yet.  Also
the wallet does not yet store the data.


Compile
-------
This is a standard qt project.  You can use qt creator or qmake to build it.
Currently the build for a Linux Desktop and Android is tested.  Other
platforms should also work as well.

Please note that you will get "unused parameter" warnings since not
many features are not implemented yet.


Important note
--------------
Since server communcation is not yet implemented, most parts of the code
s completely unstested.
